# Notes #

__Things to ask about:__

 * Link Styling
 * Div spacing (for anchors)

 __Things to make note of:__

 * `pointer-events: none;` is a really nifty thing you can throw in CSS to allow things to be clicked through an element.
 * To center something that's got `position: absolute;`: set `left: 50%;` and give a negative left margin of half the width of the object **<-- THIS IS THE BEST TRICK**
